This project is based on ESP IDF framework.
I couldn't get "Arduino as IDF component" (framework = espidf, arduino) to compile properly, so instead I used IDF and manually copied in the Arduino libraries I need. 
They did need some adjustments to the header includes to compile.
Also since Arduino isn't in the framework, PIO doesn't include the Arduino defines in sdkconfig.h.

---Platform---
;platform = espressif32
;platform = https://github.com/tasmota/platform-espressif32/releases/download/v2.0.2idf/platform-espressif32-2.0.2.zip
platform = https://github.com/tasmota/platform-espressif32/releases/download/v2.0.2.2/platform-tasmota-espressif32-2.0.2.zip
I am using a custom branch of espressif32 by TASMOTA.  The package is wrapped in a PlatformIO project, so it automatically downloads the correct Arduino and compiler libraries.
The TASMOTA project appears to be very active and includes many bugfixes.  They also roll in any changes to the base IDF.
2022-02-01 ESP recently released IDF 4.4 and TASMOTA updated to that branch, so now using 2.0.2.2.

    ;To reduce code size set a lower max log level using menuconfig. CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL=3, CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=3.
